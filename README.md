# JobListings

A Board of Job Listings has been created using Golang and GraphQL. This project's functionality is to Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete Job Listings via GraphQL. This project is used to illustrate the use of GraphQL to obtain data from more complex applications via the use of queries and mutations. The project will be further evolved to incoperate subscriptions aswell.
